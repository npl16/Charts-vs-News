# Charts-vs-News
DE4 2020 Sensing and IoT project that analyses the sentiment of UK News Headlines and names of songs in the Spotify UK Top 200 Charts on a daily basis, and features a web app (hosted at npl16.pythonanywhere.com) that generates a Spotify playlist with songs from the latest Spotify UK Top 200 chart whose names either oppose or match the current sentiment of UK News Headlines.
